* Convas 
    Convas lets you use [[https://www.instructure.com/canvas][Canvas LMS]] in the terminal, with no dependencies other than Python. 
 
    I wanted to see how far I could go with just the Python standard library and the Canvas API. There's quite a lot built into it, including
    - complete python bindings for [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses][ncurses]]
    - a requests library (urllib)
    - a cli library (argparse)
    - a logging library (logging)
    - a regex library (re)

    Convas has support for browsing: 
    + Assignments 
    + Files
    + Quizzes (including downloads)
    + Announcements

*  Installation
    - Add your Canvas API token and canvas domain in ~/.config/convas/config
    #+begin_example
    TOKEN=<token>
